# About Me<a name="about"></a>

I'm currently a junior at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China), with my graduation slated for 2025. My academic and research interests lie primarily in system security and binary exploitation, particularly in the realm of kernel security. My journey in cybersecurity has been marked by a strong commitment to learning and competing in various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Currently, I am the captain of the CTF team [Nebula (top 15 in China out of 17824 teams)](https://adworld.xctf.org.cn/teams/details?team_id=177501708).

**If my work sparks your interest or you have any job opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.** _I am actively seeking internship opportunities at this time._
