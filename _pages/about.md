# About Me<a name="about"></a>

I am currently a junior at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China), expecting to graduate in 2025. My academic and research interests are primarily in system security and binary exploitation, with a particular focus on kernel security. My journey in cybersecurity has been marked by a strong commitment to learning and competing in various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Currently, I am the captain of the CTF team [Nebula, which ranks in the top 15 out of 17,824 teams](https://adworld.xctf.org.cn/teams/details?team_id=177501708) in China.

**If my work interests you or if you have any job opportunities, please feel free to reach out. I am actively seeking internship opportunities at this time.**

*Let me know if you‚Äôd like any further adjustments or additions!*
